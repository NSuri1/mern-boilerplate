# MERN Starter/Boilerplate
## Reasoning
After coming across MERN.io, I was curious about how to get started with the MERN stack. I believe that the boilerplate they provide at https://github.com/Hashnode/mern-starter is overkill for what I wanted to do with some of my simple project ideas. In this repo, I will try to construct a friendly and easily understandable boilerplate.

### Main Differences From MERN.io Boilerplate
- Remove Redux store
- Remove server side rendering

## Quickstart
```
cd mern-boilerplate
npm install
npm start
```
